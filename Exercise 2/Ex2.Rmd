```{r warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
load(file = "test1.RData")
dat=data
attach(dat)
```

```{r}
head(dat)
```

### <u>a) Perform the multiple regression model and analyse all the outputs that are available</u>

```{r}
LM = lm(Y~.,data = dat)
```

Before analysing the outputs of test, we need to check assumptions on the noise
- Homoscedasticity: plot standardized residuals vs fitted values they seems spread equally along the ranges of predictors. 
- Gaussianity: Normal QQPlot, majority of the points are on the line
- Independency: as we have no informations we assume they are independent

```{r}
plot(LM,3)
```

```{r}
plot(LM,2)
```

Analysis of the output:

```{r}
summary(LM)
```


# **TODO**


### <u>b) What are the variables that are really connected to the response variable</u>


```{r}
step(LM)
```
